# genericBottleDefectDetection
Machine learning-based project for detection of faulty bottles.
•	System will identify dents, bumps and scratches on the bottles. Used Two-class SVM to detect non-faulty and faulty ones separately.
•	Automated the complete pipeline from Input to pre-processing, model training, feature gathering and detecting the faulty bottles.
